This is my first project using C++, file handling and command prompt, which basically works as an advisor of a shopping mall, like providing the details of products, their prices
and stock availability. In addition to it, it also provides the estimated bill.

This can be deployed at the entrance of a shopping mall and can reduce the rush inside the mall by listing all the products, so that, if the product that a customer want to buy is
not in the stock, he can immediately go to the other shop.

This will not only save's the owner's time, also saves the customer's time, like sometimes customers could be in an emergency situation.

So, to see the output, execute the program.exe file.

Thank you.
